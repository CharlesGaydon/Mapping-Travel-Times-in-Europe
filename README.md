# Mapping European Train Journey Durations

	Authors : Charles GAYDON, Paul PESEUX, Lo√Øc ROBERGEON
	This work is part of a DataViz course taught at the University of Lyon between Nov. 2017 and Feb. 2018. 

### What it is ?

Using D3.js data visualisation tool, we propose to build a web application displaying maps of Europe and France, in which the standard geographic distance is replaced to represent the time it takes by train from one city to another.

### What does it contains ?

This repository is organised as follow : 
- src: the code used to gather data on train journey durations ;
- Designs: the different sketches that paved our thinking, a process book to legend them, and an article formalizing what we want to do and who inspired us ;
- data: a list of cities and their temoral ditance matrix, as well as maybe obsolete files.
